**Monitoring Frequency**: Every 5 seconds for early detection

### ✅ Debug Configuration System
**Implementation**: Centralized debug control via `debug_config.h`
**Features**:
- Compile-time enable/disable of monitoring systems
- Configurable reporting intervals and thresholds
- Timestamp support for all debug output
- Production-safe defaults with zero performance impact when disabled

### ✅ Demo Task Removal
**Implementation**: Cleaned up main.c for production readiness
**Changes Made**:

- Simplified main application loop for irrigation control focus
- Restored appropriate monitoring frequency (20-second status updates, 60-second detailed reports)
- Added TODO placeholders for irrigation control implementation
- Maintained all monitoring systems for production reliability

### ✅ Step 3: Static File Controller with Advanced Caching
**Implementation**: Production-grade static file serving with sophisticated caching

- Thread-safe cache management with mutex protection
- Browser cache integration verified with network tab analysis
- CORS headers for cross-origin compatibility
- Comprehensive statistics and monitoring integration
**Real-World Validation**:
- Browser network tab shows "(memory cache)" for CSS files
- 0ms load time for cached content demonstrating production-grade performance
- ETag generation and 304 Not Modified responses working correctly
**Files Created**: `include/static_file_controller.h`, `src/static_file_controller.c`

### ✅ Discovery of Sophisticated IO Configuration Architecture
**Discovery**: Industrial-grade IO configuration system already designed
**Date**: January 30, 2025
**Key Findings**:
- **Sophisticated JSON Configuration**: `io_config full_ES32D26 wEnabledProcessing.json` with comprehensive I/O definitions
- **Hardware Architecture**: Shift register I/O (8 relays + 8 digital inputs) + 6 analog inputs (0-20mA, 0-10V)
- **Signal Processing**: Advanced signal conditioning with SMA filtering, lookup tables, scaling, gain/offset
- **Alarm System**: Multi-type alarm detection (rate of change, disconnection, stuck signal, max value)
- **Industrial Features**: Flow calibration, autopilot sensor integration, safety interlocks
- **SNRv8 Architecture Document**: Complete technical specification for I/O processing pipeline
**Impact**: 
- Step ordering revised to combine Configuration Management + I/O Framework as Step 6
- Implementation complexity significantly higher than initially assessed
- System represents industrial automation platform, not simple irrigation controller
- Architecture patterns from SNRv8 provide proven foundation for implementation

## Current System Status

### System Stability
- **Uptime**: Continuous operation without crashes or reboots
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized after demo task removal
- **Task Count**: 5 tasks running (main, 2 idle, 2 ipc) - demo tasks removed
- **Stack Safety**: All tasks monitored, warnings issued for high usage

### Monitoring Effectiveness
- **Memory Monitoring**: Active, automatic reporting every 30 seconds
- **Task Tracking**: Active, status updates every 20 seconds, detailed reports every 60 seconds
- **Stack Warnings**: Active, checking every 5 seconds for safety
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system reports every 60 seconds
- **Task Visibility**: Regular task listings visible in serial debugger

### Performance Metrics
- **RAM Usage**: 4.4% (14,352 bytes of 327,680 bytes) - reduced after demo removal
- **Flash Usage**: 19.2% (200,860 bytes of 1,048,576 bytes) - optimized
- **Monitoring Overhead**: <1% CPU usage
- **System Readiness**: Ready for irrigation control implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Stack Size Strategy
**Decision**: Use 2048 bytes as minimum stack size for application tasks
**Rationale**: ESP32 requires adequate stack space for function calls and local variables
**Implementation**: All demo tasks now use 2048-byte stacks
**Monitoring**: Continuous tracking shows ~90% usage, which is acceptable with warnings

### 2. Warning Threshold Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-level warning system (70%, 80%, 90%)
**Rationale**: Provides graduated alerts before critical conditions
**Implementation**: `task_tracker_check_stack_warnings()` function
**Effectiveness**: Successfully detecting high usage before overflow

### 3. Monitoring Frequency Strategy
**Decision**: Different intervals for different monitoring types
**Rationale**: Balance between visibility and performance impact
**Implementation**:
  - Memory reports: 30 seconds (low frequency, stable metric)
  - Task reports: 10 seconds (medium frequency, dynamic metric)
  - Stack warnings: 5 seconds (high frequency, critical safety metric)

### 4. Thread Safety Strategy
**Decision**: Use FreeRTOS mutexes with 100ms timeout
**Rationale**: Prevent data corruption while avoiding deadlocks
**Implementation**: All shared data structures protected by mutexes
**Effectiveness**: No data corruption observed, no deadlocks encountered
