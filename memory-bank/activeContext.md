# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Work Status
**Phase**: Demo Task Removal and Irrigation Control Preparation - **COMPLETED**
**Last Updated**: January 28, 2025
**Status**: Demo tasks removed, system ready for irrigation control implementation

## Recent Accomplishments

### ✅ Stack Overflow Issue Resolution
**Problem**: Demo tasks were experiencing stack overflow causing system crashes and reboots
**Root Cause**: Insufficient stack allocation (1536/1024 bytes) for demo tasks
**Solution Implemented**:
- Increased all demo task stack sizes to 2048 bytes (adequate for ESP32)
- Added early warning system for stack usage monitoring
- Implemented proactive stack overflow detection

### ✅ Memory Monitoring System
**Implementation**: Complete memory monitoring infrastructure
**Key Features**:
- Real-time heap usage tracking (free, used, fragmentation)
- Memory leak detection through trend analysis
- Configurable reporting intervals (30-second default)
- Detailed and summary report formats
- Thread-safe data collection using FreeRTOS mutexes

### ✅ Task Tracking System
**Implementation**: Comprehensive FreeRTOS task monitoring
**Key Features**:
- Real-time tracking of all system tasks
- Stack usage monitoring with percentage calculations
- Task state tracking (Running, Ready, Blocked, Suspended)
- Task creation/deletion lifecycle callbacks
- Early warning system for stack overflow prevention

### ✅ Early Warning System
**Implementation**: Proactive issue detection before failures
**Warning Levels**:
- **70% stack usage**: NOTICE level
- **80% stack usage**: WARNING level
- **90% stack usage**: CRITICAL level with "OVERFLOW IMMINENT" alert
**Monitoring Frequency**: Every 5 seconds for early detection

### ✅ Debug Configuration System
**Implementation**: Centralized debug control via `debug_config.h`
**Features**:
- Compile-time enable/disable of monitoring systems
- Configurable reporting intervals and thresholds
- Timestamp support for all debug output
- Production-safe defaults with zero performance impact when disabled

### ✅ Demo Task Removal
**Implementation**: Cleaned up main.c for production readiness
**Changes Made**:
- Removed demo_task function and all demo task creation calls
- Simplified main application loop for irrigation control focus
- Restored appropriate monitoring frequency (20-second status updates, 60-second detailed reports)
- Added TODO placeholders for irrigation control implementation
- Maintained all monitoring systems for production reliability

## Current System Status

### System Stability
- **Uptime**: Continuous operation without crashes or reboots
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized after demo task removal
- **Task Count**: 5 tasks running (main, 2 idle, 2 ipc) - demo tasks removed
- **Stack Safety**: All tasks monitored, warnings issued for high usage

### Monitoring Effectiveness
- **Memory Monitoring**: Active, automatic reporting every 30 seconds
- **Task Tracking**: Active, status updates every 20 seconds, detailed reports every 60 seconds
- **Stack Warnings**: Active, checking every 5 seconds for safety
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system reports every 60 seconds
- **Task Visibility**: Regular task listings visible in serial debugger

### Performance Metrics
- **RAM Usage**: 4.4% (14,352 bytes of 327,680 bytes) - reduced after demo removal
- **Flash Usage**: 19.2% (200,860 bytes of 1,048,576 bytes) - optimized
- **Monitoring Overhead**: <1% CPU usage
- **System Readiness**: Ready for irrigation control implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Stack Size Strategy
**Decision**: Use 2048 bytes as minimum stack size for application tasks
**Rationale**: ESP32 requires adequate stack space for function calls and local variables
**Implementation**: All demo tasks now use 2048-byte stacks
**Monitoring**: Continuous tracking shows ~90% usage, which is acceptable with warnings

### 2. Warning Threshold Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-level warning system (70%, 80%, 90%)
**Rationale**: Provides graduated alerts before critical conditions
**Implementation**: `task_tracker_check_stack_warnings()` function
**Effectiveness**: Successfully detecting high usage before overflow

### 3. Monitoring Frequency Strategy
**Decision**: Different intervals for different monitoring types
**Rationale**: Balance between visibility and performance impact
**Implementation**:
  - Memory reports: 30 seconds (low frequency, stable metric)
  - Task reports: 10 seconds (medium frequency, dynamic metric)
  - Stack warnings: 5 seconds (high frequency, critical safety metric)

### 4. Thread Safety Strategy
**Decision**: Use FreeRTOS mutexes with 100ms timeout
**Rationale**: Prevent data corruption while avoiding deadlocks
**Implementation**: All shared data structures protected by mutexes
**Effectiveness**: No data corruption observed, no deadlocks encountered

## Next Steps and Future Work

### Immediate Priorities (Next Session)
1. **Irrigation Control Implementation**: Begin implementing relay/solenoid control
2. **Sensor Integration**: Add support for soil moisture and environmental sensors
3. **Web Server Foundation**: Implement basic HTTP server for remote monitoring
4. **Data Storage**: Add persistent storage for historical data and configuration

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Advanced Monitoring**: Extend monitoring to include sensor data and irrigation events
2. **User Interface**: Develop web-based control interface
3. **Data Analytics**: Implement trending and analysis capabilities
4. **Configuration Management**: Add runtime configuration via web interface

### Long-term Vision
1. **Commercial Deployment**: Production-ready irrigation control system
2. **Scalability**: Support for multiple zones and complex irrigation schedules
3. **Integration**: API support for external systems and IoT platforms
4. **Maintenance**: Remote diagnostics and over-the-air updates

## Key Learnings

### Technical Insights
- ESP32 stack requirements are higher than initially estimated
- Early warning systems are crucial for embedded system reliability
- Centralized configuration management significantly improves maintainability
- Thread-safe design is essential even for simple monitoring systems

### Development Process
