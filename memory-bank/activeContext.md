### ✅ Main Task Stack Overflow Fix
**Implementation**: Increased main task stack size in primary configuration file.
**Date**: August 5, 2025
**Problem**: `main` task stack usage was at 85% (3080/3584 bytes), causing critical overflow warnings.
**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- Initial stack size of 3584 bytes was insufficient for the application's initialization routines
- Previous attempt to modify `sdkconfig.esp32dev` was ineffective due to ESP-IDF configuration hierarchy
- `sdkconfig.defaults` is the primary configuration source that takes precedence
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE=4096` to `sdkconfig.defaults` (the proper configuration file)
- Fixed flash size inconsistency by updating `sdkconfig.defaults` from 2MB to 8MB to match `platformio.ini`
- Kept the `run_psram_comprehensive_test()` call commented out in `src/main.c` as it is non-essential for startup
**Configuration Management Learning**:
- ESP-IDF configuration hierarchy: `sdkconfig.defaults` → `sdkconfig.esp32dev` → final `sdkconfig`
- Always modify `sdkconfig.defaults` for reliable configuration changes in this project
**Impact**: The `main` task now has a 4096-byte stack, providing a robust 14% buffer against overflow and ensuring system stability.

### ✅ Web Server Stack Size Configuration Fix
**Implementation**: Critical compilation error resolution for web server manager
**Date**: January 30, 2025
**Problem**: `httpd_config_t` structure member error preventing web server compilation
**Root Cause**: `ctrl_stack_size` member does not exist in ESP-IDF 5.4.1 `httpd_config_t` structure
**Solution Implemented**:
- **Simple Fix**: Hardcoded `config.stack_size = 4096` for direct, reliable configuration
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed invalid `config.ctrl_stack_size` assignment
- **Debug Logging Update**: Updated logging to remove reference to non-existent member
- **Successful Compilation**: Web server now compiles and runs successfully

**Key Technical Learning**:
- ESP-IDF documentation requires careful verification against actual API versions
- Simple hardcoded values often more reliable than complex configuration chains
- Direct value assignment preferred over configuration chain dependencies for critical parameters

**System Validation Results**:
- **Web Server Stack**: 4096 bytes properly configured and operational
- **System Memory Usage**: 10% total (healthy and stable)
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Successful connection with strong signal (-46 dBm)

## Current System Status

### System Stability
- **Uptime**: Continuous operation without crashes or reboots
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized after demo task removal
- **Task Count**: 5 tasks running (main, 2 idle, 2 ipc) - demo tasks removed
- **Stack Safety**: All tasks monitored, warnings issued for high usage

### Monitoring Effectiveness
- **Memory Monitoring**: Active, automatic reporting every 30 seconds
- **Task Tracking**: Active, status updates every 20 seconds, detailed reports every 60 seconds
- **Stack Warnings**: Active, checking every 5 seconds for safety
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system reports every 60 seconds

- **Flash Usage**: 19.2% (200,860 bytes of 1,048,576 bytes) - optimized
- **Monitoring Overhead**: <1% CPU usage
- **System Readiness**: Ready for irrigation control implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. Stack Size Strategy
**Decision**: Use 2048 bytes as minimum stack size for application tasks
**Rationale**: ESP32 requires adequate stack space for function calls and local variables
**Implementation**: All demo tasks now use 2048-byte stacks
**Monitoring**: Continuous tracking shows ~90% usage, which is acceptable with warnings

### 2. Warning Threshold Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-level warning system (70%, 80%, 90%)
**Rationale**: Provides graduated alerts before critical conditions
**Implementation**: `task_tracker_check_stack_warnings()` function
**Effectiveness**: Successfully detecting high usage before overflow

### 3. Monitoring Frequency Strategy
**Decision**: Different intervals for different monitoring types
**Rationale**: Balance between visibility and performance impact
**Implementation**:
  - Memory reports: 30 seconds (low frequency, stable metric)
  - Task reports: 10 seconds (medium frequency, dynamic metric)
  - Stack warnings: 5 seconds (high frequency, critical safety metric)

### 4. Thread Safety Strategy
**Decision**: Use FreeRTOS mutexes with 100ms timeout
**Rationale**: Prevent data corruption while avoiding deadlocks
**Implementation**: All shared data structures protected by mutexes
**Effectiveness**: No data corruption observed, no deadlocks encountered
