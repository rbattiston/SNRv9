UI_CRITICAL (3)    - Dashboard updates, status requests
NORMAL (4)         - Static files, general content
BACKGROUND (5)     - Logs, backups, maintenance
```

## Technical Architecture

### Request Flow Design

```
HTTP Request → Priority Classification → Queue Assignment → Processing → Response
     ↓              ↓                      ↓               ↓           ↓
Web Server → Priority Manager → Request Queue → Handler → Client
     ↑              ↑                      ↑               ↑
Load Monitor → System Mode → Queue Stats → Performance Tracking
```
